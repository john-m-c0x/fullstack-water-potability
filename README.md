# Water Potability - Assignment Three

This repository contains the code for **Assignment Three** of the COS30049. 
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict the potability of water based on various chemical properties using machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The Water Potability project focuses on identifying whether a water sample is potable (drinkable) or not, based on factors such as pH, hardness, solids, and others. It aims to apply machine learning techniques for classification and prediction.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your system. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Install Dependencies

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/water-potability.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd fulltack-water-potability
    ```

3. Install the necessary Node and React dependencies (node_modules):

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

This will install all required packages listed in `package.json`.
